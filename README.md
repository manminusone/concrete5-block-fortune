# concrete5-block-fortune
Block plugin for concrete5 that emulates the Unix fortune(6) command and prints a random line of text.

## Further information
This plugin gives you a basic HTML textarea to type in a series of lines. The plugin will then display one random non-blank line from that series every time a page is loaded. This is useful for displaying random sayings in, for example, the footer of your templates.

## Requirements

* concrete5.7.4 or greater (uses the help functionality)

## Installation
```git clone git@github.com:manminusone/concrete5-block-fortune.git /concrete-5-install-dir/application/blocks/fortune
```

## Usage
After installing the block you can simply drag a Fortune from the "Other" section in the Blocks sidebar. Type in your series of lines and save. You're done!
